        <h2>Poems</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the heart of Mirrorland, where Arabella's adventures are woven into poetic verses. Each poem captures a moment, a feeling, a piece of her journey.</p>
        <h3>Delusions</h3>
        <!-- I create delusions in my head to escape reality
I day dream everyday on what is imaginary 
I talk to a mirror on the wall
Wondering when would I be called
Oh I love it and hate it at the same time
Just trying to keep my head in line
But it always declines
It’ runs away to the small world It made for me
Where I always be
Dreaming in something that I will never get to see 

Wondering If this was a reality
But it is just like the feeling of air
It’s just imaginary
That is were I long to be
In a world only I can gaze upon on wishing it was a reality
I wake up everyday in a world I don’t want to be
Thinking why it was made for me
At the end I created a world in my head
Where I liked to be instead-->
        <h3>Mr. Rabbit Part 2</h3>
        <!-- I wasn’t supposed to go down the rabbit hole
But because of love, Mr. Rabbit took my heart and soul
Mr. Rabbit tall and fair you never really did take me anywhere
It was just my own delusions messing around with my head in the end it only gave me pain to bare
Yet I fell down the rabbit whole
In a dark place with nowhere to go
Nothing but dark could and rain
That’s where my heart was detained
In a maze I can’t get out
I fell down that stupid rabbit hole
Thinking I was just actually on my own

But turns out I wasn’t alone
You look at me with the same eyes you look her
But in this journey I was the one in a blur
Mr. Rabbit tall and fair you weren’t actually there
It was just me falling for you while loosing my sanity
Dreaming about things that was just imaginary 
Because you are two faced in reality
Mr. Rabbit tall and fair
I will climb back up the rabbit hole 
Taking back my body and soul -->
        <h3>Mr. Rabbit Part 1</h3>
        <!-- Mr rabbit tall and fair
Why are you always there?
Because of that I look at you and stare
Your eyes are like the galaxy 
When I look at you I feel like I'm out of reality
You clear the darkest skies in my 
I sit there and cry but you pulled me out instead
His laugh stirred my head
I fell down the rabbit hole

Giving you my heart and soul 
Your warm embrace 
Never makes me feel hate
Even though I know I hate this state 
Oh I love it and hate it at the same time
Just trying to keep my head in line
But it runs back to you where it likes to be instead
Just calling you a friend -->
        <h3>Midori</h3>
        <!-- I can spot you in the miss of the crowds
With a heart that is proud
A tall man with skin white and fair
 I look at him standing there
And he looked at me like there was something in me worth looking at

I wanted to feel nothing whenever I see him but you looked at me in the eyes and I felt everything all at one
 With eyes looking like the sun
And when I’m with him it’s really fun
This is the end for me
 My eyes can no longer see
How your just a friend to me-->
        <h3>Fallen</h3>
        <!-- I think I fell involve with you from the start
You painted colors in my heart
That I could never erase
With eyes looking like the sun
And when I’m with him it’s really fun
This is the end for me
 My eyes can no longer see
How your just a friend to me
But the heart beats for it’s self
 And no one else here -->
        <h3>Kiiro</h3>
        <!-- Your like the wind in the sea
Always pulling me back to reality
Your voice is like the waves
When I listen to it I feel like I’m being saved
Your eyes are crystal clear
Like the sea water 
Every time I see or talk to you all my troubles disappear for a moment 
Your two faced like the sea 
There are days like he is the high tied that comes a bit odd but still surprise you with his strangeness
While there are days that his like the low tied where you are calm yet mysterious but gives deep meaning to words
Your voice is one of the best things I ever heard
You saved me when I was drowning in fear
You’re light filled me with sincere -->
        <h3>Her Light</h3>
        <!-- Her light
In the sky full of stars she shines so bright
I watch her from afar because Im just a dim light 
I love her every night and day 
But she always stayed away
She was always waiting for her love everyday
Admiring his bright light
As he rises up everyday his light is so bright
So how could I hate him 

He shines so bright 
Sometimes I wish I was that light
He looks at me with that smile so bright
Wondering if we have the same feelings hiding inside
But my heart beats for her 

My moon wishing you will notice me 
So he will just let me be
Every night and day I will wait
Until my light goes away
I will always watch you 
As you admire him in a distance
I will always watch you in the side
And hope you will love me the same way
Someday -->
        <h3>Sunshine</h3>
        <!-- You're my sunshine You're like a star shining bright I admire you from far wondering if it's right At the same time you're like midnight You're like the moon shining bright 

You're the light of the day I could never stay away 
You're a ray of sunshine shining bright And you will always be that light-->
        <h3>Lost and Confused</h3>
        <!-- I don’t like him but why do I feel this way
I don’t know what to say
 I don’t hate him nor like him
 I hate this feeling
 I’m not big in relationships I’m just more down for the flirt
 I just rather not get hurt
 And suffer in a pain
 That wants me to have blood stains
 I hate him I want to wrap my hands around his neck
 But at the same time just admire him from a afar
 A light that’s dancing in the sky
 With a light so bright
 That outshines the night
 That wonderful sight
 That I talk too -->
        <h3>Cupid</h3>
        <!-- Why does Aros hate me so much?
So the point I don’t have a crush
Love is so dumb
To the point you will feel pain but it will never numb
I hate love but I want it at the same time
But Aros never gives me a sign
I say that the love I bare is mine
But why does my heart declines
I fall in love with people on paper and the screen
To me they are the most attractive people I ever seen
At some point I can’t keep my sanity because I hate reality 
I day dream everyday 
But even so Im delusional in every single way
It is a bittersweet feeling
Loving someone who isn’t real is something that is hard to deal
But its hard to seal
People say I lost my sanity 
 But I just don’t like reality
 Aros has given up on me
His given up on the love that I will never get to see
And the love I will never get to be -->
        <h3>Losing Battle</h3>
        <!-- I fell deep down the rabbit whole
 In a dark place with nowhere to go
Nothing but dark clouds and snow
Until I saw a glow
I walk towards the glow and see what it has to show
It was a tall man who’s skin was white and fair 

He said he would take me anywhere 
But spending time with him gave me pain to bare
Not knowing when I’ll get there
Until my last breath I laid there and just stared
Thinking of the day we will meet again
So what will I do then? -->
        <h3>Moving On</h3>
        <!-- And suddenly all the songs were about you
Because of that I didnt know what to do
Your voice is my favorite sound
It’s like saving when from chains I was bound
Where the light came in and I was found
You were the definition of in the world of boys his a gentlemen
Where my heart could have been
But we were in the wrong place and time
Because we didn’t have the courge to not be diclined
I hate that I’m still hoping
To the point I can’t stop coping
You were my comfort place
And that the felling I dont want to erase
But I need to let go
So I could growhere -->
